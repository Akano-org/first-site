## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

I understood git and github fundamentals, frontend web development with HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
I had hard time on css when i was trying to style my header, get all my images in the spot that i want and even get the right space for the different part of the body area.
chrome dev tool, google and even youtube was my friend when i was facing those challenges..
